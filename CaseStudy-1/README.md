Temperature sensors are widely used in electronic equipment to display the temperature. The temperature value is analog. Hence, we can convert it to digital value using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and then it is displayed. One example like You can see the digital clock displaying the room temperature value as it is due to the temperature sensor embedded in it.
