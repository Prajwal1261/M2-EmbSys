## Heat Control System

## Introduction
Heating controls allow you to easily regulate the temperature. The controls automatically turn the heating on and off based on
settings input by the user, to ensure maximum comfort. This process moves away from a fixed, traditional timer system and can therefore be used to better control the temperature say within your home.
