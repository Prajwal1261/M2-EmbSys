## Heat Control System

## Introduction
Heating controls allow you to easily regulate the temperature. The controls automatically turn the heating on and off based on
settings input by the user, to ensure maximum comfort. This process moves away from a fixed, traditional timer system and can therefore be used to better control the temperature say within your home.

## High level requirements
- Temperature information is noted down. 
- Displaying the output based on users requirement.

## Low level requirements
- Reads temperature information from temperature sensor and convert analong inputs to digital using ADC.
- The digital value of temperature is visualized using Pulse Width Modulation(PWM).

## Components needed
- ATmega328 Microcontroller
- Switch button	
- LED	
- Resistor	
- Ground
- voltage	
- Oscilloscope
