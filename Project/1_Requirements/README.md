## Distance measurement System

## Introduction
Distance measuring instruments have been in use for centuries and improvements have been made in their designs with the passage of time. Today, Distance measuring instruments such as foot ruler and inches tape are obsolete and digital instruments are used for such purposes at a larger scale.

Here Ultrasonic sensors based distance measuring is used to provide ease. Since the design is based on embedded systems and the whole process is controlled by a microcontroller, many features can be added to it.

## High level requirements
- Collecting the information of objects distance.
- Displaying the distance (in cms) of the object.

## Low level requirements
- Ultrasonic sensor to be used to collect the information.
- Display the objects distance using lcd 

## Components needed
- Arduino UNO micro controller
- Ultrasonic sensor SR04
- 16Ã—2 LCD (HDD44780 driver based)
- Potentiometer 10k ohm
- Wires
