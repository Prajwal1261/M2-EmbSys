## Automatic door opening and closing system

## Introduction
The project talks about automatic opening and closing of door which will sense the person or object approaching near the door and open automatically. Systems and methods are very common in the art for opening and closing doors to enter and exit buildings, facilities etc. Automatic doors are commonly found in retail stores, supermarkets etc.

Here Ultrasonic sensor is been used for sensing the person or object to open/close the door automatically. This system is controlled by Arduino micro controller. Use of led indicating the opening and closing of the door.

## High level requirements
- Sensing the information of the persons distance.
- Opening and closing of the door according to the distance of the person.

## Low level requirements
- Ultrasonic sensor to be used to sense the information.
- Display the persons or objects distance using lcd.
- Led ON indicating the door is opened.
- Led OFF indicating the door is closed.

## Components used
- Arduino UNO micro controller
- Ultrasonic sensor SR04
- 16Ã—2 LCD (HDD44780 driver based)
- Potentiometer 10k ohm
- Wires
- Led
- Resistor 100 ohm
- Ground
